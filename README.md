💡 Idea Board (JavaScript Only)

A pure JavaScript Idea Board application that allows users to create, manage, and organize ideas using programmatic logic only — without relying on HTML or CSS.

This project focuses on data structures, state management, and business logic, making it ideal for demonstrating JavaScript problem-solving skills.

🚀 How It Works

The app runs entirely through JavaScript.
Users interact with the system by calling JavaScript functions to:

Add ideas

View ideas

Edit ideas

Delete ideas

Persist data

The UI is represented by structured JavaScript output rather than DOM elements.
